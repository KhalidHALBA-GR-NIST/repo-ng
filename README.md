**ndn-repo-ng** uses [ndn-cpp-dev](https://github.com/cawka/ndn-cpp) library as NDN
development library, and uses sqlite3 as underlying storage.

**ndn-repo-ng** is open source under a license described in the file COPYING.  While the
license does not require it, we really would appreciate it if others would share their
contributions to the library if they are willing to do so under the same license.

See the file `INSTALL.md` for build and install instructions.

Please submit any bugs or issues to the **ndn-repo-ng** issue tracker:
